# installer
Install my base tool-chain (supports SUSE, MacOS, Debian-like and Windows kinda)


## NOTHING TO SEE HERE, YET

Just a place holder at this stage. I realise I'm probably re-inventing the wheel, and should use something like:

 * Ansible/Chef/Puppet
 * autoyast/kiwi/SUSE Studio
 * heira/yaml
 
But I don't know any of these, really, and besides, they are much more than what I intend, which more like what I've done in [The bootstrap provisioner of my hax-vm project](https://github.com/sinewalker/hax-vm/tree/master/bootstrap), but for more than just SUSE.
